**Coding Challenge**

**Assignment** 
- Create a web app called **Quoted**. 

The features of **Quoted** include:

- Users can create an account for themselves
- Users can edit their basic information
- Users can upload their profile picture
- Users can upload quotes to the app for everyone to see. Each entry should contain the following entities:
- The quote
- Name of the author
- Profile pic of the author or a placeholder if no profile pic uploaded
- timestamp of when the quote was created
- A homepage where all the quotes ever written on the app are shown in descending order of their timestamp with the most recent one on top
- Users should be logged in to use the features of the app.
- Users can edit and delete the quotes only if they are the author of the same

- **(Optional) 
Bonus:** Users can like quotes and quotes should display the number of likes received.

**Note:** The app should have firebase’s **Firestore** integrated. All the users and quotes should be stored in
the firestore. Use all the CRUD operations provided by firestore for implementing the features.

For uploading profile pictures you can use firebase’s ******************Storage.******************

Frontend framework: **Next.js**

Use a **mobile-first approach** for this challenge. Make the app desktop-responsive only if time allows, **but it is mandatory for the app to be mobile-responsive**.

This exercise is designed to give you unlimited creative freedom as you develop a solution /
implementation. Feel free to use any packages/tools as you see fit; the goal is a functional mobile-responsive app
with a reasonable amount of CSS stylings and efficient use of Firestore.

****************************Time Duration:****************************

The challenge is designed in a way that it should take 15 - 18 hours for a candidate to complete it. But we expect you to complete the challenge within 7-10 days from now, ideally.
